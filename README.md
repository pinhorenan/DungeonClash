## Dungeon Clash
Dungeon Clash is a project developed for the Object-Oriented Programming course at the Federal University of Pelotas.

## About the Project
The project's main objective is the implementation of a basic RPG system, inspired by famous tabletop RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons. Developed entirely in Java, it aims to solidify the key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming through the creation of a system with a reduced number of classes and methods, facilitating both the addition of new features and the maintenance of the code.
**This project is currently put on hold
